## FAQ

 - What is it?
 
 > Json-Explorer is a simple web page, build in react. It allows you to pick a local JSON file, and visualize its entries.
 It allows you to filter data based on attributes values.
 
 - Whey would you build that?
 
 > You can see the long answer on [the blog post](https://medium.com/@maxired/introducing-json-explorer-a-free-open-source-web-json-visualizer-227849c0f4e9), but the short answer is that I needed it to visual data from [Retromat](https://retromat.org/en/).
 
 - It is free?
 
 > Yeah, I published it with an MIT license, a really permissive license. Still, I would be happy to know how that project is useful to you.
 
 - Are you stilling my data?
 
 > Damn, no! When you pick a file, we don't upload the file anywhere. It just stays in your browser.
It is in some way a limitation because having the data in a DB would allow building a fast a powerful search engine, but it allows you to use the project with any data.
 
 - How can I be sure?
 > because the code is open-source, you can download it, audit it, and run it locally on your browser.
